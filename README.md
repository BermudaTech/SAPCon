# SAPCon
SAP RFC Connector and Code Generator

SAP NCo 3 is the current version of SAP's development environment for communication between the Microsoft .NET platform and SAP systems. This connector supports RFCs and Web services. It allows you to write different applications such as Web form, Windows form, or console applications in the Microsoft Visual Studio.Net.
With the SAP .NET Connector, you can use all common programming languages, such as Visual Basic. NET, C#, or Managed C++.

SAPCon is a helper library for SAP NCo 3 and utility tool like (svcutil.exe) that generates service model code from SAP RFC metadata. You can easily call RFC by this generated client code without knowing any information about RFC metada.
It also generates RFC metadata documentation as parameter description that makes the code easy to use and makes it displayed in IntelliSense, the Object Browser, and in the Code Comment Web Report.

You can try the generator online: http://app.sapcon.io/
